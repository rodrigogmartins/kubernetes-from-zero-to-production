# Kubernetes — From Zero to Production

> Learn Kubernetes through theory, practice, and gameplay.

This repository is a **learning playground for Kubernetes**.

It combines **theory, hands-on labs, and an interactive game** to help developers understand Kubernetes not just syntactically, but conceptually.

The focus is on **mental models**, not memorizing YAML.

## ⭐ Support the Project

If this project helped you understand Kubernetes or made learning more enjoyable,  
consider giving the repository a **star ⭐**.

It helps the project reach more people and motivates continued development.

## 📚 What you’ll find here

### 🎮 Kube Game (Available)

An interactive game where you **play as Kubernetes itself**.

Instead of directly managing resources, you:

- Define desired state
- Observe reconciliation
- Trigger failures
- Watch self-healing mechanisms in action

Each phase isolates a core Kubernetes concept and explains it progressively.

👉 **Play the game:**  [https://game.kubelab.com.br](https://game.kubelab.com.br)

📂 The game source code lives in the `kube-game/` directory.

---

### 🧠 Theory

Concise explanations of Kubernetes core concepts:

- Pods, Nodes, Controllers
- Desired vs Current State
- Reconciliation
- Self-healing

Designed to be read alongside practice.

---

### 🧪 Labs

Hands-on exercises to:

- Apply concepts in real scenarios
- Experiment safely
- Connect theory with real cluster behavior

---

## 🎯 Goal of this repository

Help developers:

- Build correct Kubernetes mental models
- Stop fighting the platform
- Understand *why* Kubernetes reacts the way it does

This is not a reference repo — it’s a **learning journey**.

## 🚧 Status

This project is actively evolving.  
Content, labs, and game mechanics may change as concepts are refined.

## 🤝 Who is this for?

- Developers new to Kubernetes
- Engineers who use Kubernetes but want deeper understanding
- Anyone tired of “just copy this YAML and trust me”

Feel free to explore, break things, and learn.

This format is intentionally designed to match:

- senior engineering reasoning
- system design interviews
- real production troubleshooting
