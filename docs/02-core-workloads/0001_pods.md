# Pods

Pods are the **smallest deployable units in Kubernetes**.  
According to *The Kubernetes Book*, everything in Kubernetes starts with Pods, but Pods are **not designed to be managed directly**.

Understanding what a Pod *is* — and what it is *not* — is critical to using Kubernetes correctly.

## What Is a Pod

A Pod is a **logical wrapper** around one or more containers that are:

- Scheduled together
- Run on the same node
- Share the same network namespace
- Optionally share storage volumes

From the container’s perspective, a Pod feels like a single machine.

## Why Pods Exist

Containers alone are not enough to model real workloads.

Kubernetes introduces Pods to:

- Group tightly coupled containers
- Provide a shared execution environment
- Serve as the **unit of scheduling**, not the container

This design allows Kubernetes to manage containers **indirectly**, enabling replacement, rescheduling, and replication without treating individual containers as first-class objects.

## The Single-Container Pod Pattern

Most Pods run **a single container**.

This is intentional and encouraged.

Reasons:

- Simpler lifecycle management
- Easier scaling and replacement
- Clear ownership and responsibility

Multi-container Pods should be used only when containers are **tightly coupled** and must share resources.

## Multi-Container Pods and the Sidecar Pattern

Pods can run multiple containers when they must:

- Share localhost networking
- Share storage volumes
- Start and stop together

A common use case is the **sidecar pattern**, where a helper container provides functionality such as:

- Logging
- Metrics collection
- Security proxies

The key rule from *The Kubernetes Book*:
> If containers must always run together, they belong in the same Pod.

## Pod Networking Model

Each Pod gets:

- A unique IP address within the cluster
- Full access to localhost communication between containers
- Flat networking (no NAT between Pods)

Containers inside the same Pod communicate via `localhost`.  
Containers in different Pods communicate via Pod IPs or Services.

Pods are **ephemeral** — their IP addresses are not stable.

## Pod Lifecycle and Ephemerality

Pods are disposable by design:

- They can be terminated at any time
- They are not repaired — they are replaced
- They should never store persistent state internally

If a Pod fails, Kubernetes creates a **new Pod**, not a repaired one.

This is a fundamental shift from traditional server-based thinking.

## Pods Are Not a Scaling Unit

Pods do **not** self-replicate.

Scaling is handled by higher-level controllers such as:

- ReplicaSets
- Deployments
- StatefulSets

Creating Pods directly is useful only for:

- Learning
- Debugging
- One-off jobs

In production, Pods are almost always created **indirectly**.

## Common Misconceptions

- Pods are not virtual machines
- Pods are not long-lived
- Pods should not be manually managed
- Pods should not be relied on for stable networking

Treat Pods as **replaceable execution slots**, not as infrastructure.

## Failure Scenarios to Understand

- Node failure causes Pods to disappear
- Pod restarts do not preserve internal state
- IP changes break direct Pod-to-Pod dependencies

These behaviors are expected and intentional.

## When to Think About Pods Explicitly

You reason about Pods when:

- Designing sidecar architectures
- Debugging networking issues
- Understanding scheduling behavior
- Investigating resource usage

You should avoid building systems that depend on **individual Pods surviving**.

## One-Sentence Mental Model
